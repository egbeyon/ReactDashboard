I'd be happy to help you create a React.js application. However, could you please provide more details about what kind of application you'd like to build? For example:

What is the main purpose or functionality of the app?
Are there any specific features you'd like to include?
Do you have any preferences for the user interface or design?
This information will help me create a more detailed and appropriate plan for your project.

I can see you're working on a financial dashboard application that displays stock market data. I've analyzed the code and created a plan that includes the core functionality for displaying financial data, searching tickers, and handling various states. Would you like to proceed with the implementation?

Build the initial prototype
Add interactive charts for financial data visualization
Add comparison feature for multiple tickers

I see you've provided an enhanced Flask backend with SEC filing analysis and MongoDB integration. I'll help implement this improved version while ensuring proper API integration.

2 hours ago

AI
To enable SEC filings data and MongoDB storage, we need two keys:

SEC API Key:

Sign up at https://sec-api.io
Copy your API key from the dashboard
MongoDB URI:

Create a free cluster at MongoDB Atlas (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
Get your connection string from the cluster
Replace <password> with your database user password
These keys will be stored securely as environment variables.

the numbers in the json are dummy data that are supposed to be computed in a function. Parameters

Return": the return of the stock return from the release of the report to the end of trading 3 days after the announcement

Volatility: the standard deviation of the stock return from the release of the report to the end of trading 3 days after the announcement

Net-Return: the daily returns of the stock from the time of annoucement of the earnings report to the closing of trading 2 days after the announcement minus
the 2 days average return of the stock prior to the announcement

Net-Return-relative-to-market: the daily returns of the stock from the time of annoucement of the earnings report to the closing of trading 2 days after the announcement minus
the 2 days average return of the s&p 500 in the same period

Looking at the requirements, I need to:

Add S&P 500 data retrieval using yfinance (ticker: ^GSPC)
Modify the calculate_returns_volatility function to:
Calculate stock returns for 3 days after announcement
Calculate volatility for this period
Compare with pre-announcement returns
Compare with market returns
Include these new metrics in the response
Let me update the Flask backend first.

The error occurs because we're trying to access market_return and market_volatility without checking if they exist. Let me update the YearlyData and QuarterlyData components to handle these cases properly.

First, I'll update YearlyData to include market metrics in the median calculations.

Looking at the code, I notice two issues:

We need to set up proper data refresh intervals to keep the stock data current
The query client is not configured to refetch data periodically
Let me update the dashboard component to implement dynamic data updates.

    retry: 1

The current implementation has unnecessary polling and refresh intervals. For earnings announcements data, we should:

Remove the refetchInterval and staleTime settings from dashboard.tsx
Update queryClient.ts to remove automatic refresh settings
Only fetch data when the ticker changes or when explicitly requested

    retry: 1,
    refetchInterval: 30000, // Refetch every 30 seconds

Looking at the dashboard.tsx and the logs, I notice a few issues:

While we removed unnecessary refetching, the query might be caching too aggressively
The queryKey structure might not be triggering proper invalidation
We should verify that the API is being called with the new ticker
Let's modify the query configuration to ensure it properly refetches when the ticker changes.

-2

  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery<StockDataResponse>({
    queryKey: [`/api/data/${ticker}`],
    queryKey: ['stockData', ticker], // Changed to array format for proper cache invalidation
    enabled: !!ticker,
    retry: 1,
    // Remove automatic refresh since earnings data is static for each quarter
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    // Ensure fresh data when ticker changes
    staleTime: 0
  });

Now let's update the query client configuration to ensure proper cache handling and endpoint construction.
